# MEMENTO - Platform for Real-time Urban Experiences

MEMENTO is an innovative platform that transforms urban commutes into engaging, discovery-filled journeys. It reimagines how we engage with the city — not as passive commuters guided by algorithms, but as attentive explorers tuned into real-time urban experiences.

## Project Overview

MEMENTO shifts our focus from screen-based distraction to place-based presence. It's not about checking in, scrolling through feeds, or arriving at a destination. It's about noticing what's unfolding around us — the sounds, sights, encounters, and emotions that make each journey unique.
